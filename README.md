# Bop the Block
Bop the Block is a simple Arkanoid/Breakout clone heavily inspired by the GB classic: Alleyway. This project is being made in order to continuously familiarize myself with C++, as well as getting to know the SDL library for game creation.

## Features
* Player paddle can move back and forth in 3 speeds
* Ball that bounces within the screen boundaries
* Collision checking that is able to tell which side the collision happened
* Ball collides with paddle and blocks
* GUI that displays points and balls left
* Read and write to a file that keeps a high score

## TODO
* Add sound effects for different collisions and death
* Add in some background music
* Read from a file that keeps level details
* Add in blocks that properly give points and disappear on collision
* Display COMPLETE when a level is complete and play a fanfaire
